SWiM - a semi-Lagrangian, semi-implicit shallow water model
===========================================================

What is SWiM
------------
SWiM is a Cartesian model which solves the linearised shallow water equations
with an orography. It uses a bi-periodic domain and an f-plane.

SWiM was written in Fortran 90 and is modularised into the logical components
involved in configuring, integration and output. It comes with alternative
algorithms for calculating back-trajectories and including orographic forcing.
However, not always are all alternatives thoroughly tested.

All Fortran code in SWiM should be documented in Doxygen syntax, so you can
create the documents in your favourite format using Doxygen (or any compatible
processor).

A number of plotting and post-processing scripts are included in the
repository. Unfortunately, these are currently undocumented but hopefully some
documentation will follow.

SWiM was developed as part of a PhD project. The PhD thesis also contains a
SWiM manual in its appendix and provides useful references to a number of
publications.
